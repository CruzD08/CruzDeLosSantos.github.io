		  <h2>✨ Expectations vs Reality ✨</h2>

		  <p>
			Traveling taught me that no matter how many videos or reviews you watch,
			nothing compares to what you experience yourself. Every trip is unique —
			no one will ever live it the same way you do. Don’t go expecting perfection;
			go open to being surprised. Let the place, the people, and the moments shape
			your story. 💙


		  <br>
			Before my friends and I traveled to Korea, we used to watch countless videos
			online — people saying that Koreans were rude to foreigners, that they avoided
			sitting next to you on the train, or that older people treated outsiders poorly.
			Without realizing it, we started to build expectations — not exactly negative,
			but full of fear and uncertainty, afraid of rejection.


		  <br>
			But once we arrived, everything was completely different. From the moment we
			stepped on that plane, kindness met us everywhere — in the smiles, the small
			gestures, and especially from the elders. Even without speaking the language,
			we always felt welcomed and respected. It made us realize how wrong social media
			can sometimes be, and how easily those opinions can shape your mindset before
			even experiencing a place for yourself.
		  <br>


			So here’s what I learned: don’t create expectations based on someone else’s story.
			Let the destination speak for itself. Every journey is personal, every encounter
			is different — just go, and let the place and its people surprise you. 🌏✨
		  <br>


			Below, you’ll find a few photos with short reflections — little moments that
			meant the most to us during our 21 days exploring South Korea. 🇰🇷💙

				  <p>This is one of my favorite photos from our trip in Jeju. From the moment we walked into
		  this restaurant, the kindness was unbelievable. The man in the photo — the owner —
		  spoke a little English and asked where we were from. When we told him the Dominican
		  Republic, he smiled and said we were the first from our country to visit his place!  
		  He took several pictures with us, even with his own phone, and let us paint our flag
		  and names on the wall behind us. His warmth made us feel so special — it’s a memory
		  I’ll never forget. 💙</p>

				  <p>Our last night in Busan was a mix of sadness and happiness. We were taking a final stroll through the neighborhood where we were staying, enjoying the atmosphere filled with little street food stalls. Suddenly, an elderly woman from one of the stalls saw us, smiled, and kindly invited us over. We sat down, and without us even ordering anything, she started serving us food, lots of things for free, simply because she felt like it. We didn't speak the same language, but we communicated through smiles, gestures, and the help of a couple who spoke a little English. She treated us like her own granddaughters, and her warmth transformed what could have been a sad farewell into an unforgettable memory. 💙</p>

				  <p>My friend is going to kill me for posting this photo here, but it’s honestly one of my favorite memories 🥹. This restaurant was just a short walk from our hotel in Seoul, so we went there many times. The old lady who worked there already knew us — she was so kind and funny. We always ordered the same thing: fried chicken and fries. Over time, it started to feel like our place. Every night we spent there was full of laughter, good food, and comfort. It’s one of those places we always talk about, because not even here in New York do we have a spot that feels like that — a place where you’re known, welcomed, and it feels like home. I really hope we can go back someday. 💙</p>

				  <p>The day we visited Pohang to see K-Drama filming spots, we went by public transportation. Getting around wasn’t easy, so we took an Uber after arriving in the city. The driver dropped us off, and later when we ordered another ride, it was the same driver again! 😭

					While driving, he noticed we hadn’t stopped at a certain scenic place, so without us asking, he pulled over and said (in Korean, but we understood): “Go, go! Take pictures!” He patiently waited while we took photos, even stopping again here by the moon sculpture. He didn’t have to, Uber drivers in Korea don’t get tips, but he still made our day so special. Thanks to him, we enjoyed Pohang so much more. 💙🌙

So we tried to help him get his phone back, and after we gave it to him, he disappeared and came back with chocolate milk and some other little packets. You can already see how happy my friend was. 😂</p>

Sitting there with our drinks, enjoying the view of the waterfalls, we couldn’t stop thinking, “We really did it. Our dream came true.” During the whole 21 days, it only rained twice — the day we left Jeju and the day we left Seoul — as if the country itself was sad to see us go. 💙🌧️🇰🇷</p>

			  <h2>🏨 Recommended Hotels</h2>
			  <p>These are some of the best-reviewed and budget-friendly places we found during our trip!</p>

			  <div class="place-grid">

				<div class="place-card">
				  <img src="images/weco-stay-myeongdong.jpeg" alt="Seoul Hotel">
				  <h3>WECO STAY Myeongdong</h3>
				  <p>Located in central Seoul, just steps from Myeongdong’s lively streets, this modern stay was the perfect base to explore the city. Comfortable, quiet, and close to everything. We spent 14 wonderful nights here. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="place-card">
				  <img src="images/busan-hotel.jpeg" alt="Busan Hotel">
				  <h3>Busan Business Hotel</h3>
				  <p>Located in Seomyeon, one of Busan’s most vibrant areas, this hotel offered the perfect mix of comfort and convenience. With shops, restaurants, and the subway just steps away, exploring Busan was so easy. We stayed here 3 nights — and I’d definitely come back!  </p>
				</div>

			  <div class="place-card">
				  <img src="images/jeju-hotel.jpeg" alt="Jeju Hotel">
				  <h3>Sungsan Marina</h3>
				  <p>During our stay in Jeju, we stayed at three different hotels, but this was our favorite. It offered beautiful views of Seongsan Ilchulbong and was surrounded by quiet beaches like Sehwa and Seopjikoji. The view of that impressive volcanic peak in the distance was the best part.</p>

			<!-- ✈️ Transportation -->
			<section id="transport" class="fade-in">

			  <h2>✈️ Transportation</h2>
			  <p>We mostly used the subway, buses, and KTX trains between cities. Here’s a quick guide to getting around:</p>
			  <ul class="info-list">
				<li>🚅 KTX train from Seoul to Busan: ~2.5 hours</li>
				<li>✈️ Domestic flight from Busan to Jeju and Jeju to Seoul: ~1 hour</li>
				<li>🚌 Jeju bus pass — I don't recommend it because you might end up waiting a long time and you won't be able to see enough of the island.</li>
				<li>🚗 Rent a car in Jeju if you want flexibility. It’s truly the best option — you can go at your own pace, with freedom and comfort, and visit so many more places. There are many rental companies in Jeju, but we chose <a href="https://www.lotterentacar.net/hp/eng/reservation/index.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=usa%5Fbrand%5Fjeju&utm_term=lotte%20rent%20a%20car%20jeju&gad_source=1" target="_blank" class="lotte-link">Lotte Rent a Car.</a></li>

			<!-- 💡 Travel Tips -->
			<section id="tips" class="fade-in">
			  <h2>💡 Travel Tips</h2>
			  <p>Some things that can help you during your stay in Korea.:</p>
			  <ul class="info-list">
				<li>💳 Get a T-Money card for subways and buses</li>
				<li>📶 Buy a local SIM or portable Wi-Fi router, you can get it at the airport</li>
				<li>💬 Learn basic Korean phrases — it really helps!</li>
